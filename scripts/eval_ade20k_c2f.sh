# Re-evaluate all four finished ADE20K probes of a run group under COARSE-TO-FINE.
#
# The probe groups train and validate under `random` viewpoints (ADE20K's historical
# default, inherited from the specialize probe, which trained on random views). This
# answers the separate question "what do these models score under the C2F deploy
# convention?".
#
# n_timesteps=21 = canvit_eval's EpisodeConfig default for policy="coarse_to_fine", so
# these are the numbers CanViT-eval would report.
#
# The two FOVEATED arms pass --override-scale 2.0: C2F's quadtree scales {1.0, 0.5, 0.25}
# are ones a fixed-scale foveated backbone never trained on (`fix_size = scale * H`), so
# unpinned every glimpse is out of distribution. Pinning keeps C2F's CENTERS and fixes the
# scale at the pretraining value -- canvit_eval's `override_scale` semantics.
#
# The four backbones below are fixed: every probe group is trained from the same four
# exp22 pretrains, so only the probe run group changes between campaigns.
#
# Usage: bash scripts/eval_ade20k_c2f.sh [run_group] [output_dir]
