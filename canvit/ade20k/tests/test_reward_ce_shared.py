"""The policy reward matches CanViT-PyTorch-RL's, at the reference's resolution.

The harness used to score the reward at the probe's native 64 with nearest-downsampled
masks, while the reference scored at score_res=128 (bilinear-upsample logits,
stride-subsample masks). That was doc 15 §A gap #5 — the last known config difference
from CanViT-PyTorch-RL. `reward_ce` is now the single implementation.

The reference arm used to be imported from `ade20k/rl_train.py`, but that file was a
PORT, and by the end its `ce_from_logits` was a one-line delegation to `reward_ce` — so
the test was asserting that a wrapper equals what it wraps. Since the consolidation
deleted the port, the arm below is transcribed from the TRUE upstream instead
(`CanViT-PyTorch-RL/src/canvit_pytorch_rl/canvas_ops.py::ce_from_logits` +
`scoring.py::per_image_ce`), which is a strictly stronger guard: it can catch a
mis-transcription that comparing against our own port never could.
