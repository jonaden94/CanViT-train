"""Load a trained CanViT from whatever you have: a training ``.pt``, a local HF-layout
directory, or a Hub repo id.

One dispatch point, so every consumer accepts all three without branching. The rule is the
``.pt`` suffix; anything else is handed to ``from_pretrained``, which already treats a
local directory and a Hub id interchangeably.

Why the metadata half exists too. A model is not only weights: a foveated/square model
pretrained at a FIXED view scale must be *evaluated* at that same scale or every glimpse is
out of distribution — which does not crash, it just decays the metric as glimpses
accumulate. CanViT-eval reads that scale out of ``config.json``'s ``metadata``. A loader
that handled ``.pt`` weights but left metadata to the config.json path would therefore load
a checkpoint successfully and silently evaluate it wrong. So :func:`read_pretrain_metadata`
returns the same dict shape from either source.

A ``.pt`` is in fact the richer source: ``pretrain_view_scale`` is derived from the
training config recorded inside it, and is written into ``config.json`` only because
``to_hf`` puts it there.
