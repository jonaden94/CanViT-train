"""Where did ``canvit.core`` come from?

The 2026-09-03 core merge moved ``canvit_pytorch`` into ``canvit/core/`` but left the old
``CanViT-PyTorch`` clone on disk on purpose — 116 launchers ``git archive`` a core commit out
of it (``unification_docs/21-core-merge.md`` §4). Both venvs still carry a stale
``_editable_impl_canvit_pytorch.pth`` pointing at that clone, so the old top-level
``canvit_pytorch`` package remains importable.

That is harmless only as long as nothing imports it. Both copies are functionally identical
today, so every other test in this suite passes whichever one wins — asking where the module
came from is the only way to catch a shadow. Hence these two tests rather than a checklist
item (§5, Trap A).
