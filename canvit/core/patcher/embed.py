"""Shared patch-embedding building blocks for the foveated / square patchers.

Both :class:`~canvit.core.patcher.foveated.FoveatedPatcher` and
:class:`~canvit.core.patcher.square.SquarePatcher` follow the same
``core-embed -> embed_head -> conditioner`` pipeline (see
``canvit/core/patcher/conditioning.py``). The only difference is the core
embed: fovi's KNN-conv (foveated) vs. a plain linear projection over a regular
square grid (square). This module factors out the parts that are identical so
the two patchers stay aligned.

    exclusion** — out-of-field samples (the pattern can slightly overshoot the

    own cells, i.e. "assuming the image is large enough to cover all samples".

    square patcher passes ``positions[~pad_mask]``), matching the notebook's
    ``pad_mask=outermost_pad_mask`` argument. A high-level characterization of
