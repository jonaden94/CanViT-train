"""Uniform-grid patcher: wraps the backbone's existing PatchEmbed.

Owns the viewpoint crop step (``sample_at_viewpoint``) that used to live in
``CanViT.forward_reduce`` / the trainer. Lifting it inside the patcher keeps
the two patcher paths symmetric: both consume an image + viewpoint and
return patch tokens + scene positions.

When constructed with ``glimpse_size_px=None`` (the downstream-app path —
classification, segmentation, etc.), the patcher skips the crop and treats
the input tensor as the already-cropped glimpse. This keeps the existing
``clf(glimpse=...)`` / ``seg(glimpse=...)`` call sites working unchanged.
