"""Foveated patcher: ``fovi`` RetinalTransform + KNNPartitioningPatchEmbedding.

Operates on the **full image** (not a pre-cropped glimpse). Foveation is
anchored at the model's current fixation point, which lives in
``viewpoint.centers`` ((row, col) in ``[-1, 1]^2``, image-coord frame). The
foveation window is set per forward by ``viewpoint.scales``: the sensor covers
a window of ``fix_size = scale * H`` px around the fixation (``scale=1`` -> full
image, ``<1`` zooms in, ``>1`` zooms out — the periphery then samples outside
the image, which is intentional). ``scale`` is per-sample (shape ``[B]``).

Per-patch positions in the visual-field frame are exposed by fovi at
``KNNPartitioningPatchEmbedding.out_coords.cartesian_rowcol`` in ``[-1, 1]^2``
(row, col); they map to image-frame scene positions as

    scene_pos = viewpoint.centers + (fix_size / image_size) * vf_rowcol
              = viewpoint.centers + scale * vf_rowcol

With ``scale == 1`` (full-image foveation) this reduces to
``scene_pos = viewpoint.centers + vf_rowcol``. Fixations near the edge (or
``scale > 1``) produce patches with ``|scene_pos| > 1`` — these encode
out-of-image patches, which RoPE handles gracefully (the model learns to ignore
them implicitly).

fovi's modules keep their sampling state as plain attributes rather than
``nn.Module`` buffers. We override ``_apply`` so that the usual
``model.to(device)`` walks those tensors too — without this, the sampling
grid stays on CPU and ``grid_sample`` errors out at the first forward.

``fovi`` is an optional dependency declared as the ``[fovi]`` extra of
``canvit``. Importing this module without fovi installed raises a
clear ``ImportError``.
