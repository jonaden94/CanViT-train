"""Patcher base class.

A Patcher maps a (full) image + viewpoint to (patch tokens, scene positions).
Two implementations:
    - :class:`UniformPatcher`: existing uniform-grid behavior — internally crops
      a glimpse via ``sample_at_viewpoint`` then patchifies with the backbone.
    - :class:`FoveatedPatcher`: foveated sampling via fovi's RetinalTransform
      + KNNPartitioningPatchEmbedding; operates on the full image, anchored at
      ``viewpoint.centers`` (``scale`` is ignored).
