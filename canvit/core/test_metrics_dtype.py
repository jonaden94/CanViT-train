"""mIoU counts are integers and must be accumulated exactly.

The accumulators were float32, which cannot represent consecutive integers above 2^24
(ADE20K val is 2000 x 512^2 = 524M pixels). CanViT-PyTorch-RL — whose published numbers
the stack is measured against — keeps per-image counts int64 and sums in float64
(`canvit_pytorch_rl/metrics.py::miou` casts `.double()`); float32 was this repo's own
deviation. Measured impact on ADE20K val is small (0.0002 mIoU).
