"""The candidate-scorer network over viewpoints: action geometry and the net itself
(state featurization lives in policy.features). One architecture, two readings of its
output map (chosen by the TRAINING objective, which lives in CanViT-pretrain):
Q-values regressed on rewards (QReg) or policy logits (PG).

Ported from canvit_pytorch_rl.policy.net unchanged except: (1) decoupled from the RL
TrainConfig (explicit kwargs only — build_scorer/objective_from_ckpt stay with the
trainer); (2) the NEW "fixation" action space for foveated/square models (user
decision 2026-07-22: actions = fixation centers only, one per grid cell over the
full field, no scale dimension). config.json schema is backward-compatible — old
checkpoints lack action_space and get the historical "safebox".

Arch [2026-06-14: import a battle-tested block, don't hand-roll init]: timm
ConvNeXt-V2 blocks. LayerNorm2d in the body (BatchNorm's running stats are corrupted
by the raw std-186 backbone features -> eval instability; the Frontend's input
BatchNorm is safe because its inputs are pre-normalized). Readout: encoder pools the
32x32 canvas to a 1x1 global bottleneck (so 'where to look' sees the whole scene);
the decoder rebuilds the full 32x32 map; scores are read at the candidate centres
through a shared head, so output cell (i,j) reads the features AT viewpoint (i,j)'s
centre — aligned by construction.

    """Frontend -> body -> readout at the candidate centres + a shared head -> one score
    per candidate [B, n_scale, cpa, cpa] (cpa=centers_per_axis).

    ``readout`` selects the body, i.e. how much of the scene one candidate's score sees:

    * ``"unet"`` (default, the historical architecture) — a ConvNeXt-V2 U-Net: the encoder
      pools 32->1, so every score is conditioned on a GLOBAL bottleneck, and the decoder
      rebuilds a full-image-registered 32x32 map. "Where to look" sees the whole scene.
    * ``"local"`` — no U-Net: score each candidate straight off the ``Frontend`` map with a
      1x1 conv. The ``Frontend`` is itself purely per-token (BatchNorm, per-group 1x1
      convs, LayerNorm2d, a 1x1 token-MLP, 1x1 out — no spatial mixing), so a candidate's
      score depends only on the canvas cell it sits on. This is the ``autoreg_tryout``
      policy head (``nn.Linear(D, 1)`` per state token -> a heatmap over grid cells);
      ``block_layers`` is unused in this mode.

      NB exact one-cell-per-score alignment needs ``centers_per_axis == 32`` (the
      ``POLICY_GRID`` the features arrive on): at a coarser grid the candidate centres fall
      between map pixels and ``grid_sample``'s bilinear interpolation mixes a 2x2
      neighbourhood. ``autoreg_tryout``'s heatmap was defined ON its state grid, so
      ``centers_per_axis=32`` is the faithful setting.

    Hub I/O follows the release-stack pattern (PyTorchModelHubMixin + the loud
    strict-load SafeHubMixin): the __init__ kwargs ARE config.json, so
    `ViewpointScorer.from_pretrained(repo_or_dir)` reconstructs the exact
    architecture, and `save_pretrained`/`push_to_hub` publish it. ``readout`` is
    backward-compatible exactly like ``action_space``: a published config.json without the
    key loads as ``"unet"``, so every existing checkpoint keeps working."""
