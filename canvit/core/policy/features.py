"""Canvas state -> scorer input: the derived, scale-equalized feature groups and the
encoder that builds them. Ported from canvit_pytorch_rl.policy.features, decoupled
from the RL TrainConfig (explicit canvas_grid / feature_groups arguments).

FEATURE_GROUPS names the groups in channel order; ent/ent_delta/cos_* are 1 channel,
ln_feat/feat_delta are canvas_dim wide. The probe-entropy groups (ent, ent_delta)
require a task probe — tasks without one (e.g. distillation pretraining) select the
four intrinsic groups (master plan §3: feature groups are task-configurable)."""
