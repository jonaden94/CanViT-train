"""Read a CanViT training ``.pt`` checkpoint written by *either* trainer schema.

Two writers exist and they nest things differently:

* **legacy / flat** (CanViT-train's original ``train/loop.py``): ``state_dict`` plus
  top-level ``backbone_name`` / ``canvas_patch_grid_sizes`` / ``training_config_history``.
* **unified trainer** (CanViT-train's ``harness/infra/checkpoint.py``): ``model_state``
  plus a nested ``metadata`` dict built from the task's ``checkpoint_metadata``.

Anything that loads a ``.pt`` must normalize first, or it KeyErrors on ``state_dict`` --
or worse, silently reads ``pretrain_view_scale=None`` because ``training_config_history``
is not at the top level, which is the foveated out-of-distribution footgun these helpers
exist to prevent (a model evaluated at a view scale it never saw does not crash; its mIoU
just decays as glimpses accumulate).

This lives in ``canvit.core`` rather than in the trainer because it is needed by every
consumer of a checkpoint -- the model constructors here, the trainer's HF exporter, and
CanViT-eval. It is pure dict manipulation: no torch, no I/O.
