"""CanViT + SegmentationProbe head, in one ``nn.Module``.

Construction goes through :meth:`CanViTForSemanticSegmentation.from_pretrained_with_probe`,
which loads a pretrained CanViT and a separately trained ``SegmentationProbe``
from repo IDs or local checkpoint directories so callers do not manage the two halves
separately. Mirrors :class:`CanViTForImageClassification`'s API shape.
