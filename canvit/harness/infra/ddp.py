"""Task-neutral multi-GPU sync for the unified harness (design §9).

**Uniform MANUAL sync — deliberately no ``nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel`` wrapper.**
Two of the three tasks reach their backbone as ``model.canvit(...)`` from inside their
bound task (ade20k/in1k), not through the top module, so a DDP wrapper on that module
would be silently BYPASSED and those gradients would never be AllReduced — the exact
silent-mis-train failure §9 says to avoid. Instead every supported cell uses the pattern
``train/joint.py`` already uses for the scorer and IN1k for ``clf.canvit``:

  * :func:`broadcast_parameters` once after construction  => all ranks start identical;
  * :func:`allreduce_grads` once per step, after the (possibly chunked) backwards and
    BEFORE clipping => all ranks apply the same update, so the weights stay identical.

Averaging before the clip matters: clipping rank-local gradients and averaging afterwards
is not the same operation, and train/loop.py averages first (DDP's Reducer runs during
backward, and the scorer is explicitly AllReduced before its clip).

One AllReduce per step is also fewer collectives than a wrapper would issue under chunked
TBPTT, where every chunk's ``backward()`` triggers its own Reducer pass.

The §9 support matrix itself is enforced upstream by ``check_spec(..., is_dist=True)``,
which refuses the coupled ``policy_grad_to_backbone`` cell under DDP.
