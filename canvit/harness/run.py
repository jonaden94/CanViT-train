"""The single run orchestration for the unified harness (design §2 ``run.py``, D-B).

``run(task, spec, settings)`` is the one path all three peer tasks take:

    build_model → build_policy (joint) → apply_requires_grad → build_optimizer
    → build_loaders → build_selector → run_training_loop (+ eval/log/ckpt hooks)

Everything task-specific lives behind the ``RunTask`` seam (a run-level ``Task``:
``tasks/{distill,ade20k,in1k}/task.py``); everything task-neutral is here or in the
sibling harness modules (rollout / optim / checkpoint / loop / policy). This subsumed the
four former entry points (the ``train`` distill loop, ``ade20k.train``, ``in1k.train`` and
``ade20k.rl_train``) into one ``TrainSpec``-driven call, and as of the 2026-07-31
consolidation those four are DELETED — this is the only training entry point in the repo.
Historical launchers still reach them via commit pinning; see the README.

Config is **composed** (D-B), not one mega-dataclass: the task holds its own per-task
config; :class:`RunSettings` carries the harness-level, cross-cutting knobs; ``TrainSpec``
carries what-trains-under-which-loss. ``run`` writes checkpoints LOCALLY only (D-G); HF
publishing stays the manual ``python -m canvit.checkpoint.to_hf`` step.
