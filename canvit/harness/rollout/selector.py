"""Viewpoint-selection seam for the unified harness (unification master plan §4.2).

A Selector decides where the next glimpse goes, consulted inside the rollout.
P1 ships RandomSelector only — a byte-for-byte extraction of training_step's
historical closures (``_foveated_random_vp`` / ``make_named_vp`` and the
per-rollout scale draw): same RNG calls in the same order, so the parity probe
digest is unchanged. PolicySelector / MixtureSelector (ε-curriculum) arrive in
P3/P4 — the ``state`` and ``t`` arguments exist for them and are unused here.
