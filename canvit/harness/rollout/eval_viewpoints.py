"""One validation-viewpoint interface for all three tasks.

Before this module each task picked its validation trajectory a different way, not by
design but by inheritance — every task's ``evaluate()`` was lifted from a different
ancestor and kept that ancestor's habit:

  * distill  <- the old pretrain loop's ``validate()``  -> quadtree C2F (uniform) /
                the deterministic centre+3x3 fixation trajectory (foveated)
  * ade20k   <- the specialize probe, which TRAINED on random viewpoints, so it
                validated on random too -> IID random, with no knob at all
  * in1k     <- canvit_eval's deploy convention -> C2F, and it already had the knob

Nothing about the tasks requires this. The *metrics* genuinely differ (mIoU vs top-1/5
vs cosine-to-teacher) and stay task-owned; the viewpoint sequence is a rollout concern
and belongs here. This module is that seam: one option set, one place where the
patcher-awareness rule lives, and ``"policy"`` — deploy the learned scorer by argmax —
available to every task instead of only to the standalone RL trainer.

**Defaults are deliberately NOT unified.** Each task keeps exactly the trajectory it
used before (see ``HISTORICAL_DEFAULTS``): flipping ade20k to C2F would silently break
comparability with every specialize probe number and every exp24 run, and flipping
distill would break the exp22/23/26 val curves. The knob is shared; the default is
per-task and documented. ``"auto"`` means "whatever this task has always done", so
every existing config is a no-op through this module.
