"""The task-neutral step-based training driver (design §1, §Loop).

ONE loop for all three tasks. It owns the task-agnostic mechanics — per-step
rollout → grad-clip → optimizer/scheduler step, plus logging / checkpoint / eval
cadence — and delegates everything task-specific to the ``Task`` seam (data via the
caller's iterator, per-batch targets via ``task.bind``, metrics via ``on_eval``).
There is only a step loop (owner decision: step-based only). All three tasks —
including in1k, whose config is now step-based (``max_steps``) like the others — feed
this same driver.

This is deliberately thin: the heavy, task-specific machinery (distill's teacher /
normalizer / webdataset-resume, ade20k's mIoU eval, in1k's top-k) lives in each
``Task``, never here (design §1 "keep the outer loop thin"). DDP grad-sync for
in-rollout modules (backbone/scorer) is the manual-AllReduce path (design §9); it is
wired here for the scorer and completed in the DDP stage.
