"""`override_scale` pins eval glimpse SCALES while leaving CENTERS untouched.

The knob exists so a fixed-scale foveated backbone can be deployed under a policy whose
scales it never saw (C2F's quadtree is {1.0, 0.5, 0.25}; `fix_size = scale * H` makes
every such glimpse OOD). Two properties have to hold or the measurement is silently
wrong: centers must survive, and the default must be a bit-exact no-op — `in1k`'s
foveated `auto` deliberately routes to UNPINNED C2F for exp25/exp29 comparability.
