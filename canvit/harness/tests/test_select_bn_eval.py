"""BN mode (b) in the harness selector: available, off by default, digest-safe.

`PolicySelector` reused ONE train-mode scorer forward for both the glimpse choice and the
policy loss. The scorer carries a BatchNorm, so selection ran on batch statistics where the
RL reference uses running statistics — 45.7% of chosen glimpses differ, and mode (a) measured
0.19 mIoU t4 worse at matched CE (exp27 arm A vs arm C).
