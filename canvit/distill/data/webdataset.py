"""WebDataset-based training loader.

Used for training only; validation always reads the raw ImageNet-1k val
ImageFolder (see `create_loaders` / `IndexedImageFolder`), independent of the
training data source.

Each rank receives a deterministically computed list of shard paths (via
`schedule.compute_schedule_slice`). DataLoader workers then split those shards
via `wds.split_by_worker` — each worker streams one or more shards sequentially.
The actual `num_workers` is derived from `cfg.num_workers`, capped at
`shards_per_gpu`, and rounded down to a divisor of `shards_per_gpu` so every
worker gets the same number of shards.

Loader interface is the one `loop.py` drives (`next()` returning a Batch), so it can
call `train_loader.next()` without modification.
