"""Task seam for the unified harness (unification master plan §4.2).

A Task owns the per-glimpse objective: what the model output is scored against
and which loss terms are active. P1 ships DistillTask only — a byte-for-byte
extraction of training_step's historical ``compute_loss`` closure. The ADE20K
and IN1k tasks (with their own targets/heads/data) arrive in P2/P5; the full
interface (build_data/build_targets/reward) grows with them.
