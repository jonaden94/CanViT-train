"""Downstream checkpoints must record their ARCHITECTURE, not just a ``model_repo`` path.

A pointer is not a description. It can move, be unreadable by another member of the
project, or -- for a FINETUNE -- stop describing the model that was trained, because
finetuning changed the backbone and the checkpoint is then the only place those weights
exist. So ``ade20k``/``in1k`` ``model_config()`` records exactly the constructor arguments
``CanViTFor{SemanticSegmentation,ImageClassification}.from_checkpoint`` needs.

The full weight-level round trip lives in CanViT-PyTorch's ``tests/test_checkpoint_sources.py``
(it owns the constructors). What is pinned here is the trainer's half: that every required
key is recorded, and that values are read off the MODEL rather than the config, so they
cannot disagree with the weights.
