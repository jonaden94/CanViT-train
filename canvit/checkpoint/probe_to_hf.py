"""Export the trained ADE20K probe out of an ``ade20k`` checkpoint into the HF layout.

Why this exists separately from ``to_hf``: ``to_hf`` publishes whole models (a distill
checkpoint becomes ``CanViTForPretrainingHFHub``, an in1k one the classifier layout) and
refuses an ``ade20k`` payload. But an ade20k probe checkpoint is not a model to publish --
its backbone is frozen and already published elsewhere, and the only new thing in it is the
150-class segmentation head.

That head is exactly what ``--cfg.probe-repo`` wants: policy training and probe finetuning
call ``CanViTForSemanticSegmentation.from_pretrained_with_probe(pretrained_repo=...,
probe_repo=...)``, and ``probe_repo`` is read with ``SegmentationProbe.from_pretrained``,
i.e. an HF directory, NOT a harness ``.pt``. Without this step a trained probe cannot be
used as the reward model for a policy run at all.

Usage:
    python -m canvit.checkpoint.probe_to_hf \
        --pt-path  <run>/checkpoints/best.pt \
        --out-dir  <run>/checkpoints/best-probe-hf

The pretrained BACKBONE is not written here and is not needed: it is whatever
``model_config["model_repo"]`` of the source run pointed at, and the caller passes it as
``--cfg.model-repo``. Both halves are required to rebuild the model.
