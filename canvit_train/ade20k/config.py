    geometry (a circle stays a circle), matching how the backbone was pretrained and how
    the probe trains; the cost is that long-side content is thrown away, so the mIoU is over
    the central crop rather than the whole image.

    Which to prefer for a FOVEATED/square model: for comparison against **human** viewing,
    aspect-preserving is the better match, since the cortical-magnification geometry is
    defined on the undistorted scene — a human looking at the same picture does not see it
    anisotropically stretched. For comparability with the **original CanViT** results,
    squish is fine, and the distortion is a mild domain shift, not a broken input (unlike a
    view-scale mismatch, which really does degrade the canvas — see ``foveated_scale``).
    NB the truest "what a human sees" option would be padding/letterbox (preserve aspect
    AND the full frame), which is not implemented: ``ResizeMode`` is center_crop | squish."""
