"""Validate distill's WebDataset multi-job resume on the REAL shard schedule (GPU, offline).

This is the production SLURM-array pattern: each array task runs exactly
``steps_per_job`` steps over its own shard slice, checkpoints, exits; the next task
resumes and must read the NEXT slice. Getting the offset wrong silently re-processes or
skips training data, which is why the harness raises instead of guessing.

Two legs through ``run()`` on the real IN21k feature-webdataset, plus four refusal cases:

  leg 1  fresh          -> job_index 0, steps 0..SPJ, checkpoint carries resume_state
  leg 2  resume         -> job_index 1, steps SPJ..2*SPJ, and a DISJOINT shard list
  refuse mid-job save   -> a checkpoint whose scheduler disagrees with the job boundary
  refuse changed batch / steps_per_job / world_size (shard-schedule inputs)
