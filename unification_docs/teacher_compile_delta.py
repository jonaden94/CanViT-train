"""Does compiling the DINOv3 teacher change the distillation targets?

`train/loop.py` compiles BOTH under `cfg.compile` ("Compiling teacher and model"); the
harness compiles only the student ("Compiling model (torch.compile)"). Verified from the
exp23 job logs, so every harness-vs-oldloop comparison so far has had a compiled teacher
on one side and an eager one on the other.

That matters because the teacher produces:
  * VALIDATION targets  (tasks/distill/task.py::evaluate)  -> val/scene_cos_norm_t*, the
    exact series used to judge exp23/exp26
  * RAW-shard TRAINING targets (tasks/distill/task.py::_teacher_targets), the exp21
    on-the-fly path

If eager and compiled teachers agree to ~1e-7 this is a non-issue. If they differ at
1e-3, it is a candidate explanation for the residual uniform gap (harness sat ~0.0021
below the old loop, negative at 15/18 eval points) and must be fixed before any further
A/B is trusted.
