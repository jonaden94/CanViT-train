# exp32 SEED SPREAD — how much does a foveated teacher-init pretrain move between seeds?
#
# WHY. exp32-fovi-teacherinit (seed 0) runs ~0.019 below exp22-fovi-teacherinit in
# val/scene_cos_raw at matched steps under a matched eval convention. Three questions were
# ruled out for that gap (eval scale, canvit_pytorch pin, optimizer grouping) and one
# candidate survives with weak support (normalizer_shards, accepted diff #1 in
# exp32-fovi-teacherinit.sh). Before chasing a cause we need the null: the seed-to-seed
# spread of THIS config, which nobody has measured.
#
# The old loop never called torch.manual_seed, so each of its runs drew a different init --
# its three foveated samples span 0.022 in scene_cos_raw at step 65536. The harness DOES
# seed (harness/run.py:204, before build_model), so its runs at one seed agree to ~0.005.
# That 0.005 is nondeterminism, NOT init spread, and using it as the noise floor is what
# made the gap look systematic. This run group measures the real thing.
#
# WHAT CFG_SEED MOVES. torch.manual_seed(seed + rank) before build_model (random init of
# every non-teacher-initialised parameter) AND the webdataset shard schedule. It does NOT
# move the normalizer statistics: since fd83930 the stats pool the first n SORTED shards,
# so the distillation targets are seed-independent and identical to exp32-fovi-teacherinit's.
#
# SEEDS 1..5. Seed 0 is exp32-fovi-teacherinit itself -- already running, so it is a free
# sixth sample. Do not re-run it here; it would collide with that run's directory.
#
# LENGTH. 25 x 8192 = 204800 steps, not exp32's full 1130496 phase A. The gap is fully open
# by step ~40k (-0.025) and narrows after, so 200k spans the whole interesting region and
# overlaps every other foveated run we have.
#
# READING IT. Compare on train/full/scene_cos_raw, NOT the val curve: exp22's val is split
# at step 139264 by the d2f7b50 eval-scale fix and reads ~0.029 low before it. Reference
# points at step 40960 -- old loop: 0.8391 / 0.8474 / 0.8662 (n=3, spread 0.027);
# harness seed 0: 0.8286 (exp32), 0.8321 (exp28), 0.8412 (exp26, 1-shard normalizer).
# If seeds 1-5 spread over ~0.02 and straddle the old-loop values, the gap is the seed
# lottery and there is nothing to fix.
