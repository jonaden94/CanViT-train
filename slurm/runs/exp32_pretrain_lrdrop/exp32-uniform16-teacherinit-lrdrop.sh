# exp32 PHASE B — the x0.1 LR drop for exp32-uniform16-teacherinit.
#
# DO NOT SUBMIT until exp32-uniform16-teacherinit has actually produced step-630784.pt. Phase A's
# array is a budget, not a schedule (job_index comes from the checkpoint, so the step count
# advances only for jobs that succeed) -- check the file exists first. The guard below
# refuses to submit otherwise, which is the whole safety property: the drop point is a
# FILENAME, so it cannot fire early, late, or twice no matter how many array tasks failed.
#
# Mechanism (identical to exp22's lrdrop branches):
#   CFG_SEED_CKPT -> SEED mode: loads model weights + standardizers + model config; FRESH
#     optimizer/scheduler/step=0; NEW wandb run (parent untouched). Parent step k <-> k-630784.
#   CFG_WARMUP_STEPS=0 -> pure ConstantLR: LR = peak_lr = 4e-5 from step 0 (= 4e-4 x 0.1).
#   --cfg.init-backbone-from-teacher is DROPPED even for the teacherinit arms: the seed
#     checkpoint already carries trained weights, so the flag would re-init the backbone
#     and then be immediately overwritten by the seed load.
#   Fresh Adam moments are the one unavoidable difference vs literally continuing the parent
#     -- SEED mode carries no optimizer state. Standard for LR-drop branch experiments.
#   Data: fresh run -> shard schedule restarts at job 0, so early shards repeat. Harmless.
#
# ARRAY 0-24%1: 25 x 8192 = 204,800 steps after the drop, per the owner's spec (the exp22
# branches instead ran to the parent's full 2,007,040-equivalent -- deliberately shorter here).
