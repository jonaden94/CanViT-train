# exp35 — ADE20K viewpoint-POLICY (QReg) through the HARNESS, 10 seeds, at the CURRENT code base.
#
# Recipe = exp27's ARM "lossfix" (slurm/runs/exp27/policy-lossfix-s0.sh) verbatim; only the
# pins and the run group change. That arm is the right base because it is the HARNESS path
# at pin bc0b16b, i.e. AFTER the one real harness/rl_train divergence was fixed (the policy
# gradient was 0.8x). After that fix the two training paths are bit-identical, so this is
# "our own ported q policy", which is what is being re-verified here.
#
# NOT based on exp27's bneval / pooled / oldloop arms: despite their names those submit
# slurm/archive/ade20k/train_policy.sbatch, i.e. the DELETED `canvit_pretrain.ade20k.rl_train`
# reference implementation. They are the reference the harness was judged against, not the
# harness itself. (This is easy to get wrong -- bneval's header is inherited text from the
# old-loop arm and reads as if it were the reference.)
#
# THE FROZEN BACKBONE. The owner asked to take the backbone out of one of the published
# ade20k-policy HF checkpoints. That is neither possible nor necessary:
#   * Not possible -- those checkpoints contain NO backbone. `best.pt` holds only
#     `net_state` (452 tensors, 5.68M params, 22.7MB safetensors) = the ViewpointScorer.
#     Policy training freezes the backbone, so it is never saved.
#   * Not necessary -- every one of the 21 published policy checkpoints records
#     model_repo = canvit/canvitb16-add-vpe-pretrain-g128px-s512px-in21k-dv3b16-2026-02-02,
#     and that string is ALREADY `Ade20kConfig.model_repo`'s default (ade20k/config.py:48).
#   So the owner's premise -- one identical backbone shared by all published policies -- is
#   correct and verified; it just needs no flag. CFG_MODEL_REPO is deliberately NOT set.
#   That backbone is the published Feb-2026 pretrain, NOT any exp22/exp28 model, so exp35 is
#   independent of exp28/exp29/exp30 -- and directly comparable to exp27.
