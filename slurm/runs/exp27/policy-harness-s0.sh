# exp27 ARM B — the SAME recipe through the UNIFIED HARNESS.
#
#   python -m canvit_train.harness.run ade20k --preset policy_only
#
# This is the run the whole session was building toward: the first production-scale
# test of the harness's policy path. `claude_dev/unification/14-parity-coverage.md` calls
# the joint policy path "the substrate for all CanViT-RL work" whose first real run
# doubles as its production gate — this is that run.
#
# Judged against ARM A (exp27-policy-oldloop-s0), not against the published band,
# so the comparison carries no hardware or stack confound.
#
# CONFIG MAPPING — rl_train -> harness (claude_dev/unification/15 SS A). Everything below
# is a deliberate match; anything NOT listed is already identical by default
# (model_repo, scene_size 512, batch_size 16, mode=frozen,
# and the whole JointPolicyConfig: qreg, scales (0.5,0.25), centers_per_axis 16,
# width 128, block_layers 3, prime_on_policy 0.5, dueling, lr 2e-4, wd 1e-2,
# betas (0.9,0.95), warmup_frac 0.125, target_momentum 0.997).
#
#   rl_train train_horizon=4  ->  --cfg.n-timesteps 5   (t0 full + 4 policy glimpses)
#   rl_train max_steps  = 640_000 // (16 * (1+4)) = 8000
#   rl_train probe      = probe-ade20k-40k-s512-c{canvas_grid}-in21k
#   rl_train NO augment ->  --cfg.no-augment
#   deploy eval + CE-based best.pt  ->  --cfg.eval-policy policy
#   squish resize       ->  CFG_RESIZE_MODE=squish   (see below — NOT the harness default)
#
# RESIZE MODE IS THE MEASUREMENT CONTRACT, not a tuning knob. CanViT-PyTorch-RL
# squish-resizes image AND mask to scene_size everywhere (its dataset class is named
# Ade20kSquish; config.py's docstring calls it "the measurement contract every entry
# point builds on"), and the qband band + EG-C2F baselines exist ONLY under squish.
# `Ade20kConfig.resize_mode` defaults to center_crop — the right default for NEW work
# (aspect-preserving, matches pretraining) but NOT band-comparable: the first exp27
# attempt ran center_crop on both arms and came out 0.016 CE "better" than the band,
# ~20x the band's own 0.0007 seed spread. Set it explicitly here, forever.
#
# THE ONE KNOWN REMAINING DIFFERENCE (doc 15 SS A gap #5, owner-deferred): the
# reward is scored at the probe's native 64x64 grid here, vs score_res=128 in
# rl_train. The reward FORMULA is identical. If this arm misses arm A, that is the
# first thing to suspect.
#
# NOTE on --cfg.no-augment: it must live in EXTRA_ARGS, NOT as CFG_AUGMENT=False.
# tyro renders bools as paired flags (--cfg.augment / --cfg.no-augment), while the
# launcher's CFG_FOO_BAR mapping emits `--cfg.foo-bar VALUE` — which cannot express
# a flag. Caught by a local smoke before submitting.
#
# NOTHING IS SUBMITTED by writing this file.
