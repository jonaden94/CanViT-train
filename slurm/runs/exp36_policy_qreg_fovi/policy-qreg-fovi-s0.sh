# ADE20K viewpoint POLICY (QReg) on our OWN foveated model: the exp22 foveated-teacherinit
# backbone plus the ADE20K probe trained on it. The counterpart of the exp35 policy runs,
# which use the published backbone and probe instead.
#
# THE TWO HALVES. A policy run needs both, and neither alone is enough:
#   --cfg.model-repo   the frozen pretrained backbone
#   --cfg.probe-repo   the trained segmentation head -- it IS the reward model (the reward
#                      is the fraction of the probe`s CE a glimpse removes, so a random head
#                      makes the reward pure noise)
# Both flags take a training .pt, a local HF directory, or a Hub id, so the probe is passed
# as the checkpoint the probe run wrote. No conversion step.
#
# Both halves are the training checkpoints themselves. Nothing is exported first; the HF
# layout is for publishing, not for feeding one of our own runs into another.
#
# CANVAS_GRID 32 IS NOT OPTIONAL. The probe was trained at canvas_grid 32, so a policy run
# at another grid feeds the reward model a canvas resolution it never saw and the reward
# degrades silently. The exp35 recipe uses 64 because ITS probe was trained at 64. Match the
# probe you are actually using.
#
# FOVEATED SCALE 2.0 IS NOT OPTIONAL EITHER. A foveated backbone derives its fixation window
# as fix_size = scale * H, so a rollout at a scale it never saw makes EVERY glimpse out of
# distribution. It does not crash -- mIoU just falls as glimpses accumulate.
#
# NOT YET RUN. The recipe is the exp35 policy arm with this backbone+probe swapped in and the
# grid matched to the probe. That arm runs against the published UNIFORM backbone; this one
# is foveated, so the policy`s action space becomes the fixation grid rather than the
# safe-box grid. The config is validated (tyro parse + spec resolution) but no training step
# has been taken with it. Treat the first run as a smoke test: eval/miou_t0 is the
# pre-policy glimpse -- for a foveated model at a FIXED scale that is the CENTRED foveation,
# not a full-image view -- so it should match a probe-only eval of the same pair before
# later timesteps are trusted.
#
# WHAT THE POLICY CHOOSES HERE. With foveated_scale.mode=fixed every glimpse is the same
# foveation pattern and only the fixation centre changes, t0 included; the window is
# fix_size = scale * H, so at 2.0 it spans twice the image side. The policy picks where to
# spend resolution, not what is visible -- hence an action space of centres with no scale
# dimension. (per_rollout/per_glimpse differ: there t0 falls back to scale 1, a true
# full-image anchor.)
