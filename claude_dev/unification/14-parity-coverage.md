# 14 — Parity coverage: what is actually checked, and what each tool cannot see

Written 2026-07-27, after the exp23 foveated regression showed that the parity apparatus
had two blind spots that together let a real bug reach a 12-hour production run.

## The two blind spots

1. **One configuration.** Every pre-existing check ran the *uniform* patcher on a
   *non-modulated* backbone — `parity_probe.py` builds `create_backbone("vits16")` with
   the default patcher; `harness_realdata_ab.py` hardcodes `is_foveated=False`. The
   foveated path had **zero** same-seed coverage. Uniform passing at scale while foveated
   failed at scale was therefore not bad luck: uniform was the only thing being checked.

2. **Step, not setup.** Those checks compare the per-step rollout *from an already-built
   model state and batch*. The exp23 bug was in **setup** — `init_normalizer_stats_from_tar`
   received `cfg.normalizer_max_samples or 512`, clobbering the documented `0` = "whole
   shard" sentinel, so the two stacks standardized against different statistics. Both
   called the identical function, so every step-level check agreed.

## What now covers them

| tool | question it answers | cost |
|---|---|---|
| `parity_probe.py` | did *this* refactor change the old loop's loss stream? (uniform) | seconds, CPU |
| `parity_configs.py` | does the harness rollout equal `training_step` **per patcher**? | ~6 min, CPU |
| `setup_arg_parity.py` | do both stacks pass shared setup helpers the same **arguments**? | ms, AST only |
| `specialize_equivalence.py` | is the ADE20K port equivalent to `canvit_specialize`? | ~2 min, CPU |
| `capability_matrix.py` | what can each task actually do? (generated, drift-tested) | seconds |

`parity_configs.py` and `setup_arg_parity.py` are complementary and neither alone would
have caught exp23: the rollout math was always correct (it agrees to `0.00e+00` on every
patcher), and the argument was always the bug. `setup_arg_parity` was validated against
commit `24a8500` and does report the historical mismatch.

## Results (2026-07-27)

**Cross-config rollout parity — all exact.** Old `training_step` vs harness `run_rollout`,
same model state, same batch, same RNG:

```
uniform             fov=False  max_reldiff=0.00e+00
uniform+modulated   fov=False  max_reldiff=0.00e+00
foveated            fov=True   max_reldiff=0.00e+00
foveated+film       fov=True   max_reldiff=0.00e+00
foveated+modulated  fov=True   max_reldiff=0.00e+00
square              fov=True   max_reldiff=0.00e+00
square+modulated    fov=True   max_reldiff=0.00e+00
```

Both stacks also derive `is_foveated` identically for `square` — the "square counted as
uniform" bug is gone and now has a regression guard.

**specialize ≡ port (ADE20K probe) — every shared component exact.**

```
SegmentationProbe       same class object (specialize imports core's)
ce_loss                 delta 0.00e+00
mIoUAccumulator         delta 0.00e+00
LR trajectory (40k)     max|dLR| 0.000e+00   (byte-identical builder on both sides)
val transforms          both resize modes, 4 images: 0.00e+00
train augmentation      real pipeline, 3 images: 0.00e+00
uniform viewpoint law   identical centers+scales, 10 glimpses x 2 start modes
```

This **closes the P2 gate's open caveat**. That gate found the port below specialize at
every timestep (-0.0023 -> -0.0068, widening with t) and flagged it as "too consistent to
call pure noise… worth ONE seed-repeat before quoting port numbers in the paper". A
seed-repeat could never have settled it (specialize's probe is unseeded). Component
equivalence does: the gap is seed noise, not a port defect.

Note the P2 gate was like-for-like on resize: at its pin `7e5afac` the port still
hardcoded `"squish"`, exactly as specialize does.

## The one deliberate divergence: val `resize_mode`

`canvit_specialize` **hardcodes** `make_val_transforms(cfg.scene_size, "squish")`. The
port lifted it to a config knob whose default is `center_crop` (commit `1a0b452`, "Lift
val resize_mode into ADE/policy configs, default center_crop").

So a bare-default port run is **not** measuring what specialize measured. Pass
`--cfg.resize-mode squish` to reproduce old numbers. The exp24 launchers already do
(`CFG_RESIZE_MODE=squish`). `specialize_equivalence.py` reports this as a DIFF note
rather than a failure — extending specialize is allowed; extending it *silently* is not.

## Round 2 (2026-07-27, later): broadening setup-arg parity found two real regressions

`setup_arg_parity.py` initially covered 2 helpers on 1 stack pair. Broadened to **9
helpers across all 3 pairs** (`train/loop.py` <-> distill task + run.py;
`ade20k/train.py` <-> ade20k task; `in1k/train.py` <-> in1k task). That immediately
surfaced two genuine divergences of the same shape — *the harness reads a config/student
value where the old loop reads the real TEACHER*:

**(1) `teacher_dim` was hardwired to 768.** `train/config.py:113` documents the field as a
PLACEHOLDER — "overridden by create_model based on actual teacher" — and `train/loop.py:294`
duly passes `create_model(backbone, teacher.embed_dim, cfg)`, which `create_model:63`
assigns back onto the config. The harness passed `cfg.model.teacher_dim`, making that a
**self-assignment no-op**. Correct by coincidence for dinov3-vitb16 (768); a vitl16 teacher
is **1024**, and 5 exp21 launchers use exactly that. All 5 are still on the old loop, so no
harness run was corrupted — it would have fired on the first ViT-L harness run, which is
precisely what the unification is meant to enable. Fixed: the width now comes from the
teacher's HF config (no full model load), except on resume/HF-seed where the checkpoint's
config is authoritative. Verified: vitb16 -> 768, vitl16 -> 1024.

**(2) `scene_size_px` used the STUDENT's patch size, in two places.** The scene must
tokenize into G x G *teacher* patches — the teacher produces the targets — and
`train/loop.py:307-308` sizes it from `teacher.model.config.patch_size`. The harness used
`model.backbone.patch_size_px` in both the raw-shard path and, separately, in `evaluate()`
(the val scene, i.e. what `val/scene_cos_norm_t*` is computed at). Identical while student
and teacher are both /16 — as in every config to date — so no run was affected. Fixed in
both places.

**(3) `compile_teacher` was never called by the harness.** Confirmed from the exp23 logs:
old loop `"Compiling teacher and model"`, harness `"Compiling model (torch.compile)"`. So
every harness run drove an EAGER teacher for validation targets while the old loop drove a
compiled one. **Measured before fixing** (`teacher_compile_delta.py`, A100): eager vs
compiled teacher features agree to `1-cos = 1.19e-07`. So this could NOT have explained any
observed metric gap — hypothesis raised and empirically rejected. Wired up anyway, for
speed and to remove a gratuitous asymmetry.

Documented non-divergences (encoded as `KNOWN_ABSENT`, so they are decisions rather than
oversights): ade20k's `make_optimizer_and_scheduler` is absent by design (the harness builds
optimizers from `TrainSpec`; numerical equivalence to specialize's `WarmupOneCycleLR` is
proven by `test_onecycle_matches_ade20k_reference_scheduler`), and in1k's
`from_pretrained_with_new_head` only *looks* absent because both stacks go through the
shared `in1k.train.build_classifier`, which lives in `train.py`.

## Settled: the uniform harness-vs-oldloop gap is noise (owner, 2026-07-27)

exp23 uniform showed the harness below the old loop at 15/18 eval points past 32k (mean
-0.0021), largest early (-0.024 at 16k) and decaying. A seed-1 old-loop noise floor was
built to test it; the owner ruled the difference noise and the trainings equally good, so
it was **not submitted** and the launcher was deleted. Do not re-open this.

## exp26 read-out: the foveated production gate PASSES (2026-07-28)

exp26 finished (harness arm 8/8 tasks = 57,344 steps; old-loop seed-1 arm 7/8). Verdict
below. **Judge this on TRAIN metrics, not val** — see the eval-scale caveat two sections
down; train is also the less noisy signal.

Binned `train/total_loss` (16,384-step bins) at step 49,152, five runs of the *same*
fovi-teacher-init config:

| run | loop | seed | loss | scene_cos_norm |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `exp23-fovi-ti-oldloop` | old | 0 | 0.908 | 0.761 |
| `exp22-fovi-teacherinit` | old | 0 | 1.036 | 0.726 |
| `exp26-fovi-ti-oldloop-seed1` | old | 1 | 1.082 | 0.711 |
| **`exp26-fovi-ti-harness-normfix`** | **harness** | 0 | **1.074** | **0.714** |
| `exp23-fovi-ti-harness` (pre-normfix) | harness | 0 | 1.121 | 0.700 |

**Spread among the three OLD-LOOP runs = 0.174 loss / 0.050 cos.
Harness to nearest old-loop run = 0.008 loss / 0.004 cos.** The harness sits inside the
old loop's own run-to-run envelope with a ~20x margin. Even the pre-normfix harness is
only 0.038 outside it, which reframes the original "foveated regression" as substantially
a baseline-choice artifact.

### The methodological trap (this is the reusable lesson)

The verdict rule as originally written compared the harness against `exp23-fovi-ti-oldloop`
alone — and that run is the **fast outlier** of the three. Any single old-loop run is an
unusable baseline for this config, because:

- `exp22-fovi-teacherinit` and `exp23-fovi-ti-oldloop` are **the same seed (0)** with
  identical config, launcher, sbatch, venv and pins, and they still diverge to **-0.129**
  loss at step 32,768 — then **re-converge monotonically** to -0.039 by step 196,608.
  Transient trajectory divergence during the 100k-step warmup.
- Same-seed rerun spread (0.128) is most of the seed-to-seed spread (0.174). The seed is
  not even the dominant variable; plain rerun nondeterminism is.

Root cause is uncontrolled execution nondeterminism, not configuration. The runs are
**functionally equivalent** — verified exhaustively: all 151 wandb config keys match
except `seed` + 4 identity keys; launcher `CFG_*`/`OPT_*` lines diff clean (and exp22's are
unchanged since its original commit `7ded881`); `WORLD_SIZE=1` in every task;
`slurm/archive/base_train.sbatch` has no commits since before 2026-07-08 (it is NOT
commit-pinned, so this had to be checked); venv `.venv-cu126` / torch `2.11.0+cu126`
installed Jun 24 and untouched; `canvit_pytorch 3277048` + `fovi c399d3b` on every single
array task. What is *not* controlled: the A100 40GB/80GB mix (exp22 149/8, exp23 18/7,
exp26 4/3) under TF32 + cuDNN autotune + `compile=True`.

**Rule going forward: never gate a production A/B on one baseline run.** Two old-loop
seeds is the minimum; three is what made this readable.

### Coverage asymmetry, stated plainly

The **uniform** pair ran 25 array tasks (~205k steps); the fixed **foveated** harness arm
ran only 8 (~57k steps). The 57k window does cover where the original bug became
unmissable (24k-41k), which is why this is a pass rather than "too early" — but it is not
the same standard as the uniform arm, and should not be described as if it were.

### Caveat: exp22 fovi val curves are broken before their break step

The exp22 arrays were submitted at pretrain pin `66a12c4` and resumed on `fe24aa1`. The
only substantive commit between them is `d2f7b50` *"validate: run foveated eval viewpoints
at the training scale (fixed mode)"* — `make_eval_viewpoints_foveated` previously hardcoded
`scales=1.0`, and this config trains at `--foveated-scale.fixed-scale 2.0`, so the early
part of every exp22 **fovi** run was validated at a fixation window it never trained on.
(It is a no-op only when `fixed_scale == 1`, which is not this config.)

`exp22-fovi-teacherinit` jumps **+0.058 in a single eval** at exactly step 139,264 (task 17,
the pin boundary), and its gap to the same-config exp23 rerun collapses from ~0.080 to
~0.019 there. Old-pin task counts: `exp22-fovi-teacherinit` 0-16 (break 139,264),
`exp22-fovi` 20 (~163,840), `exp22-fovi-nocond` 17 (~139,264). Uniform runs are unaffected.

**Training is untouched** — `d2f7b50` modifies only `make_eval_viewpoints_foveated`, the
`validate()` call site in `loop.py`, and `viz/validate.py` (read the diff, not the commit
message). So train metrics remain comparable across the pin change, which is exactly why
the verdict above is built on them.

Operational lesson: a long `%1` array pins per **task**, at task start — so one run can
straddle a code change. Grep `Pinned canvit_train →` across *all* of a run's logs, not
just task 0.

## What is NOT claimed

- The **foveated** rollout is deliberately NOT identical to specialize: specialize's
  uniform-only viewpoint sampler put every foveated glimpse out of distribution
  (mIoU *decreasing* with glimpses, job 15025338). The port delegates to `RandomSelector`.
  Identity here would mean reproducing a bug.
- `parity_configs.py` uses synthetic targets and identity denorm, so it does not exercise
  the normalizer. That is `setup_arg_parity.py`'s job, by design.

### Open items as of 2026-07-28 — reproduction is proven, new capability is not

Everything above establishes that the harness **reproduces the old loop**. That is a
different claim from "the harness is correct", because the unified harness also has
capabilities the old loop never had. Those rest on unit + smoke tests only:

| item | status |
|---|---|
| DDP at production scale | mechanically validated on 2xA100 ([[ddp_validation.md]]); never a real run. Owner deprioritized. |
| foveated past 57k steps | unmeasured on the fixed harness |
| `teacher_dim` fix | only fires on a ViT-L teacher; no harness run has used one |
| ade20k `finetune` mode + `probe_repo` head init | added 2026-07-27, unit-tested, never production-run |
| joint task+policy on ade20k/in1k | the flagship new capability; 10-step integration smokes only |
| policy-DEPLOY validation (`eval_policy="policy"`) | added 2026-07-28 for all three tasks; unit + real-tiny-model tests only, never production-run. Before it, a `policy_only` run validated on RANDOM glimpses and selected `best.pt` on that — so this is a prerequisite for reading any RL result, not a nicety |
| harness RL **recipe** parity vs `rl_train.py` | the harness now has the CAPABILITY but NOT the recipe — 4 knobs still differ (Adam betas, LR ramp, train-data augmentation, step budget) + the deferred reward `score_res`. Do not call the harness a reproduction of the RL flagship until closed. Table + fix per knob: [[15-rl-recipe-parity-and-open-items.md]] §A |
| eval ROLLOUT unification ("layer 2") | `eval_policy` unified WHICH viewpoints; the four eval rollout loops are still separate. Deferred until after the ADE20K policy gate, on purpose. Why it is non-trivial (fold-vs-list memory, `run_rollout` carries the digest, `forward_reduce` is a core API): [[15-rl-recipe-parity-and-open-items.md]] §B |
| in1k finetune head-init (`8f780ba`) | exp25 arrays still in flight, not read out |

The first three are reproduction-adjacent and low risk. The last three are new function —
no parity tool speaks to them, and only runs will close them. In particular **the joint
policy path is the substrate for all CanViT-RL work**, so the first real RL run doubles as
its production gate.
