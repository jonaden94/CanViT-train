# RL recipe parity + two deferred unifications (2026-07-28/29)

Written after the shared `eval_policy` knob landed (doc 07, "Validation viewpoints").
Two separate things are recorded here: **what still differs** between the validated RL
trainer and the harness path, and **one architectural unification deliberately deferred**.

---

## A. `rl_train.py` vs `harness.run ade20k --preset policy_only` — the recipe gap

**Status (2026-07-30): CLOSED. The harness reproduces the recipe.** Every gap below is
closed, the harness eval is bit-identical to the validated eval (§A2), and BN mode (b) —
the last gap — is the default on both paths (§A3). Historical detail kept below because
several of these were silent failures worth recognising again.

`ade20k/rl_train.py` is gate-validated on this cluster (jobs 15025279 / 15025337,
mean t1–t4 val CE 0.6855 / 0.6867 vs the qband band 0.6853 ± 0.0007 — see `p3-notes.md`).
The harness path has never been run at scale.

### Already identical (verified by reading both, 2026-07-28)

Candidate grid (`scales=(0.5, 0.25)`, `centers_per_axis=16` → 512 candidates); scorer arch
(`width=128`, `block_layers=3`); `prime_on_policy=0.5`; policy LR 2e-4 / WD 1e-2; grad clip
1.0 with the scorer clipped SEPARATELY from the model; the reward formula
`(prev - cur)/prev.clamp_min(1e-4)` off a full-scene t0 anchor; per-depth `RunningNorm`;
ε-greedy DAgger.

**BN mode was NOT identical** and was the last real gap — see §A3. Mode (b) (a separate
eval-mode forward chooses the glimpse) is now the default on both paths.

### CLOSED 2026-07-29 — the harness can now EXPRESS the recipe

| # | knob | `rl_train` | was | fix landed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Adam betas | `(0.9, 0.95)` | every group silently got torch's `(0.9, 0.999)` | **`GroupOptim.betas`** (shared harness type) threaded into `AdamW`; default `(0.9,0.999)` so no existing group moves. Policy default from `JointPolicyConfig.policy_betas=(0.9,0.95)` |
| 2 | LR schedule | ramp over `warmup_frac=0.125`, then **hold** | policy group fell through to `ScheduleSpec()` = `warmup_steps=0` → **no ramp** | `cli.resolve_spec` now builds the policy group from `JointPolicyConfig` (`policy_warmup_frac=0.125`, `warmup_constant`) |
| 3 | train data | **NO augmentation** — `make_val_transforms` on BOTH splits (rl_train.py:349-353) | `make_segmentation_train_transforms` unconditionally | **`Ade20kConfig.augment`** (+ the same-named `In1kConfig.augment`), default `True` |
| 4 | step budget | 8000 = `640_000 // (batch * (1 + train_horizon))` | ade20k default 40000 | plain config value; no code needed |
| 5 | reward resolution | `score_res=128` | probe grid (64) | **CLOSED 2026-07-30.** `Ade20kConfig.reward_score_res=128`, and BOTH entry points now compute the reward through ONE function (`ade20k/metrics.py::reward_ce`); `rl_train.ce_from_logits` delegates to it, pinned bit-identical. Falls back to full res with a warn-once when `score_res` does not divide the mask resolution |
| 6 | **probe head** | trained probe via `from_pretrained_with_probe` (default `probe-ade20k-40k-s512-c{grid}-in21k`) | `build_model` gated `probe_repo` on `mode=="finetune"`, so a FROZEN (= policy) run built a **fresh RANDOM head** | `probe_repo` now honoured in both modes + `build_policy` WARNS when a policy run has none |

**Gap #6 was the blocker, and it was silent.** The scorer's reward is the fraction of the
PROBE's CE a glimpse removes. `--preset policy_only` runs in `mode="frozen"`, where
`probe_repo` was documented as "Ignored" — so the harness would have trained a policy
against an untrained head, on pure reward noise, with nothing failing and every log
looking healthy. Found 2026-07-29 only by constructing the A/B command end to end rather
than checking the knobs individually. Lesson: knob-by-knob parity is not run-level parity.

Pinned by `harness/tests/test_rl_recipe_knobs.py` (14 tests) against rl_train's own constants.

**Why #3 needed its own flag** (do not "fix" this by tuning the aug knobs): setting
`aug_scale_range=(1.0,1.0)` and `aug_flip_prob=0.0` does NOT disable augmentation.
`make_segmentation_train_transforms` still applies `RandomCropWithLabel` **and** an
unconditional `PhotoMetricDistortion` (colour jitter with no exposed parameter). Identity
knob values give you a *differently* augmented pipeline, not an unaugmented one — exactly
the silent near-miss that would make a harness-vs-`rl_train` comparison unreadable.

**Distill has no config-time run length.** `policy_warmup_frac` resolves against
`cfg.max_steps`, which ade20k and in1k have and **distill does not** — it is
SLURM-array-shaped (`steps_per_job`), so its total is unknown when the spec is built. The
first version of this fix returned 0 there *silently*, i.e. reintroduced gap #2 on the
distill policy path. `cli._policy_warmup_steps` now WARNS in that case, and
`JointPolicyConfig.policy_warmup_steps` (absolute, wins when > 0) is the escape hatch.
Pinned by `test_distill_has_no_config_time_total_so_the_frac_warns_instead_of_vanishing`.

**Unification note (owner asked, 2026-07-29).** #1 and #2 are *shared implementation* —
one `GroupOptim`, one `resolve_spec` — so a policy group on distill/ade20k/in1k gets the
same recipe from a single code path; the test parametrises over tasks to prove it rather
than assume it. #3 is a *shared interface only*: `augment` means the same thing on both
downstream tasks but the bodies differ (dinov3 segmentation transforms vs
`RandomResizedCrop`+flip), so forcing shared code would abstract over things that are not
alike. #5 is genuinely ade20k-only — `score_res` is a segmentation-resolution concept;
in1k's per-image loss is a scalar CE over classes and distill's an MSE over patches.

**Superseded 2026-07-30.** This paragraph used to warn that "can express the recipe" ≠
"reproduces the band" and that the harness path had never run at scale. Both are now
settled: exp27 ran it (see §A3), and the remaining deliberate deviation — the in-graph
rollout — was shown to cost nothing once glimpse SELECTION was fixed to eval-mode BN.
`pooled_policy_loss` (the other half of the in-graph deviation) remains available and
unvalidated, but is not needed for parity.

Horizon mapping, for whoever wires this: `rl_train`'s `train_horizon=4` means t0-full + 4
policy glimpses (the docs' "T=5", band reported over t1–t4) → harness `n_timesteps=5`.

### Gap #7 — RESIZE PROTOCOL (found 2026-07-29 by a run, after this doc had already warned about it)

`rl_train` defaulted to `resize_mode=center_crop` while the band is **squish**. An earlier
revision of this section noted that and was then ignored when exp27 was configured — the
first attempt ran center_crop on both arms and arm A came out at **0.6693**, 0.016 *better*
than the band and ~20× its 0.0007 seed spread. Not a better policy; a different measurement.

Squish is CanViT-PyTorch-RL's *measurement contract*, not a preference: `config.py`'s
docstring ("images and masks squish-resized to `scene_size`"), `CLAUDE.md:30`
("Measurement = the paper's (squish) protocol, **always**"), and a dataset class named
`Ade20kSquish`. At the P3 gate commit `7e5afac`, `rl_train.py:329` hardcoded `"squish"`;
commit `1a0b452` lifted it to a knob defaulting to `center_crop`.

Fix: `PolicyTrainConfig.resize_mode` pinned back to `squish` (it is the frozen reference);
`Ade20kConfig` **deliberately keeps `center_crop`** — aspect-preserving, matches
pretraining, the right default for new work, and the exp24 probe/finetune runs used it.
A policy run under any non-squish mode now logs a not-band-comparable warning.

**Lesson, and it is the same one as gap #6 one day later:** writing the discrepancy into a
doc does not protect a run. Gap #6 was caught by constructing the command end to end; #7
was caught only by *executing* it and disbelieving a good number. A config difference that
moves the metric needs an assertion or a warning at the point of use, not a paragraph.

### Everything else: audited clean against the original repo (2026-07-29)

Read end to end against `canvit_pytorch_rl/{config.py,training/{config,train,eval_loops}.py,data.py}`:
same `model_repo` (`DEFAULT_PRETRAINED_REPO`) and probe rule; the same
`make_val_transforms` function (core's copy is equivalence-tested against specialize's for
**both** modes, `specialize_equivalence.py:133`); full val split (`stride=1, limit=None`);
eval CE at full 512² (`ce_from_logits(...)` with no `score_res` — "full 512^2, sharing the
mIoU logits"); objective = mean CE over t1..t4; and every recipe hyperparameter matching
`TrainConfig`. `rl_train.py`'s only other drift since the gate is additive (per-timestep
mIoU, richer ckpt). Immaterial diff: eval batch 32 vs 16 — does not touch
the metric (eval-mode BN, dataset-level mIoU, per-image CE mean).

### Recommended sequence

1. Control: `rl_train` at current HEAD, seed 0 (~65 min, one A100). Re-confirms the gate at
   today's code and produces a LOCAL CE+mIoU reference, so later comparisons are not against
   another machine's numbers. (The 2026-07-23 gate runs predate `845e401`, which added mIoU,
   so they logged CE only.)
2. Close 1–4 above, then run the same recipe through the harness and compare against that
   local control — not against the published band.

---

## A2. RESOLVED 2026-07-30: the harness eval was wrong, and the cause was a corrupted probe

**The harness eval is now bit-identical to the validated eval** — 0.0000 on every metric
(mIoU t0..t4 and mean CE), at matched eval batch size. Runnable check:
`claude_dev/unification/eval_equivalence.py`.

Coverage extended 2026-07-30 to **all three model sources**, because "two harness
checkpoints" left open the possibility that the two evals agreed only on models the harness
itself produced. All three sources share an identical 452-key scorer `state_dict`, so a
published or `rl_train` checkpoint loads into the harness scorer unchanged:

| source | ckpt | delta HARNESS vs VALIDATED |
|---|---|---|
| published HF qband | `qpolicy-…-s0` | **0.0000** on t0..t4 + ce_mean |
| ported trainer (`rl_train`) | bneval s0 `last.pt` | **0.0000** |
| unified harness | `step-8000.policy.pt` | **0.0000** |

Independent cross-check on the ported source: the harness eval reproduces `rl_train`'s OWN
logged per-timestep mIoU on its own checkpoints to <=0.01 (s0 42.86/43.84/44.44/44.89 vs its
logged 42.86/43.85/44.44/44.88; s1 identical to 2dp). Note what this does and does not
establish: we never executed CanViT-PyTorch-RL's eval code. The chain is *our validated eval
reproduces their published per-seed numbers to +0.0002 CE / -0.04 mIoU*, and the harness eval
is bit-identical to that. Agreement-with-published-numbers, not code-level identity.

### Root cause: StateEncoder construction polluted the probe's BatchNorm

`StateEncoder.__init__` builds an image-independent template by running the segmentation
probe on a blank canvas (`init_reference`). `harness/run.py` builds the policy at line 277
but freezes the model at line 280 — so that forward ran with the head in **train mode**, on
a batch of **one** synthetic canvas. Two effects, both measured:

1. It **polluted `head.bn.running_mean` by 1.074**. `apply_requires_grad` then froze BN at
   those corrupted values for the entire run, degrading EVERY timestep including t0
   (39.030 instead of 39.579) — and corrupting the policy REWARD, which is that probe's CE
   reduction.
2. The template itself came out **1.621288** off, and that exact number propagated into
   every `ent_delta`/`cos_init` feature, shifting **14/32** of a trained policy's chosen
   glimpses and costing ~0.1 mIoU at each policy step (0.117/0.110/0.101/0.090 at t1..t4,
   reproducible on two checkpoints).

Fixed in **canvit_pytorch `1f5121b`**: `init_reference` forces eval mode for that forward
and restores the caller's mode. Fixed in core rather than by reordering `run.py` because no
caller should have to know that constructing a feature encoder depends on module mode, and
an init template is by definition a property of the weights. Pinned by
`canvit_pytorch/policy/test_init_reference_mode.py` (4 tests).

`ade20k/rl_train.py` was never affected: it calls `seg.eval()` before constructing its
encoder.

### Eval batch size shifts absolute mIoU by ~0.06 — fix it before comparing

Not a bug, but it invalidates careless comparisons. Same checkpoint, same code:

| eval batch | t0 mIoU | t4 mIoU |
|---|---|---|
| 16 (`measure_miou_order` default) | 39.57 | 44.90 |
| 32 (`Ade20kConfig.eval_batch_size`) | 39.58 | 44.84 |

bf16 kernels differ with batch shape, and near-tied candidate scores then flip some
glimpses. **Quote absolute mIoU only with the eval batch size stated.**

Batch size is the ONLY remaining sensitivity. An earlier revision of this section also
blamed cross-process "bf16 nondeterminism" for a ~0.5 mIoU swing — **that was wrong and is
retracted.** After the `1f5121b` fix, two independent processes running
`plot_policy_curves.py` on identical inputs produced BIT-IDENTICAL output: max|Δ| = 0.0000
across 5 baseline curves and 25 policy-seed values. The swing was entirely this bug (whether
a `StateEncoder` had been constructed in train mode before evaluating). An unexplained
~0.5 mIoU difference is a defect, not arithmetic.

### How this was nearly missed — read before debugging anything similar

Two wrong conclusions were published to this doc en route, both from bad methodology:

1. "Localized to `deploy_rollout_viewpoints`" — from comparing 38.948 and 39.579 measured
   in **separate processes**. In one process they were identical.
2. "There is no bug; the harness eval is fine" — from same-process t0 comparisons that
   agreed. They agreed because **both sides shared the corrupted probe**. t0 is also the
   one timestep that cannot expose a glimpse-SELECTION difference.

**Rule: when two implementations agree with each other but neither matches an external
reference, suspect shared upstream state — not the comparison.** And always compare at
t>=1, not just t0, when the suspect is anything policy-driven.
---

## B. DEFERRED: unify the eval ROLLOUT (the "layer 2" unification)

The `eval_policy` work unified **which viewpoints** validation takes. It did NOT unify
**how the rollout runs**. Training is already unified (`harness/rollout.py::run_rollout`
drives all three tasks); evaluation still has four separate loops:

| loop | used by |
|---|---|
| `ade20k/rollout.py::rollout_canvas_hidden` | ade20k eval |
| `in1k/rollout.py::rollout_cls_tokens` | in1k eval |
| core `CanViT.forward_reduce` | distill eval |
| `canvit_eval/episode.py:99` | benchmarking (other repo) |

These are the same loop with different readouts, so this is principled to unify. Two things
make it non-trivial, and both are the actual content of this note:

1. **`run_rollout` cannot simply be reused.** It calls `.backward()` and owns BPTT chunking
   and policy-loss accumulation, so it breaks under `no_grad`. Reusing it means splitting it
   into a neutral glimpse-driver + the training concerns — and `run_rollout` carries the
   parity digest `9a0100a1a3de3acd`. Highest-risk refactor in the repo (the digest test is
   the safety net, so it is tractable, but it is not a side quest).
2. **The unified abstraction must be FOLD-based, not list-based.** ade20k/in1k want a list of
   per-timestep readouts, but distill deliberately does not keep one — `ValAccumulator`'s
   docstring records the memory reason ("Metrics computed on full batch -> scalar -> discard
   tensors; PCA viz: sample 0 only -> O(T) not O(B×T)"). A rollout returning per-t tensors
   would reintroduce exactly the O(B×T) cost that comment guards against. `forward_reduce`'s
   `init_fn`/`step_fn` IS the right shape; the list-collecting loops are its degenerate case.

**The concrete blocker is small:** `forward_reduce` takes a viewpoint **list**. If it took a
`next_viewpoint(state, t)` callable, then closed-loop policy eval works for every task with
no extra forward, `rollout_canvas_hidden` and `rollout_cls_tokens` both delete, and distill
keeps its streaming accumulator untouched. But `forward_reduce` lives in **core**
(`canvit_pytorch/model/base/impl.py`), which is the published-model surface and is imported by
CanViT-eval — so this is a cross-repo API change, not a pretrain-local one.

**Visible symptom until then:** distill's policy-deploy eval runs the student backbone rollout
TWICE (select, then replay through the unchanged `forward_reduce`). Teacher forward, IN1k
probe and PCA still run once. ~2,560 extra student glimpse-forwards per validation (256 samples
x 10 glimpses), once per 1000 steps — well under a percent, which is why it was accepted.
ade20k/in1k pay nothing; their eval loops were converted to select-and-step.

**Sequencing (owner, 2026-07-29): do this AFTER the ADE20K policy gate run**, so that a wrong
RL result cannot be confounded between "the port is broken" and "the refactor is broken". The
gate result then becomes the fixed reference to re-verify the refactor against.

---

## A3. BN mode (b) — the last gap, and what actually closed it (2026-07-29/30)

`rl_train` and the harness both used to CHOOSE the training glimpse with the same
train-mode scorer forward that carries the policy loss ("mode (a)"). The scorer holds one
BatchNorm, so that normalizes on BATCH statistics where CanViT-PyTorch-RL uses running
statistics — it could afford a separate eval-mode forward because it collected the rollout
detached. The modes disagree on **45.7%** of chosen glimpses.

Measured on full ADE20K val at the LAST step (best-checkpoint selection adds noise that
hid the effect at n=2), scored by the validated eval:

| | mean(t1–t4) CE | mIoU t4 |
|---|---|---|
| band, last step (published) | 0.6863 | 44.91 |
| `rl_train` mode (b) | **0.6863** | **44.90** |
| `rl_train` mode (a) | 0.6874 | 44.72 |

Mode (b) is now the default on both paths (`PolicyTrainConfig.select_bn_eval`,
`JointPolicyConfig.select_bn_eval`). The `PolicySelector` primitive keeps mode (a) as ITS
default so non-opting callers stay byte-identical and the `run_rollout` parity digest
`9a0100a1a3de3acd` is untouched — the digest is measured with no policy attached.

It is also the train/deploy-consistent choice: deployment always selects under eval-mode
BN, so mode (a) trained on a state distribution the deployed policy never visits.

### Two methodology traps this cost us, worth reading before the next A/B

1. **The first read of mode (b) was a false NULL.** Comparing at each seed's *best-CE*
   checkpoint, one seed's best fell at step 6000 — a less-trained checkpoint — and the
   selection noise swamped a real +0.18 mIoU. **When the effect is smaller than
   checkpoint-selection variance, compare at a FIXED step.** The band publishes a
   last-step row for exactly this reason.
2. **A 45.7% action-flip rate proved the mechanism was ACTIVE, not that it MATTERED.**
   Mechanism tests are for cheaply killing hypotheses (a 0.2% flip rate would have ended
   it), never for confirming them.

## A4. Baselines available for the Figure-4B axis (2026-07-30)

`entropy_coarse_to_fine` (EG-C2F) is ported from `canvit_eval/policies.py` — the
implementation the published row came from — and **validated to max|Δ| = 0.05** against
paper Table 4 (it is deterministic there, so that is a real check). `coarse_to_fine`
matches to 0.07 (a mean of n=10 in the paper, so within CI). Targets live in
`harness/eval_viewpoints.py::PAPER_TABLE4_C64`.

**`random` is NOT the paper's F-IID.** It measures +0.17…+0.42 above that row, growing
with t: t0 matches (it does start full-scene) but the glimpses follow the safe-box AREA
law rather than F-IID's fixed fovea scale. Do not label it F-IID. F-IID and R-IID are
not reachable from this module today.

Plot everything with `claude_dev/unification/plot_policy_curves.py`, which computes all curves
in ONE process at ONE eval batch size — required, since absolute mIoU shifts ~0.06 with
eval batch size (§A2).

### A4 results — the Figure-4B comparison (2026-07-30, 5 harness-trained seeds)

Full ADE20K val, c64, squish-512, ONE process at eval batch 32. Produced by
`plot_policy_curves.py`; the JSON is `claude_dev/unification/band_harness_5seed.json` (moved out
of the repo root 2026-07-31). The PNG was untracked and has been deleted — regenerate with
`plot_policy_curves.py --out <path>`; the numbers below are the durable record.

| policy | t0 | t1 | t2 | t3 | t4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Viewpoint-Q trained** (n=5, mean) | 39.58 | **42.58** | **43.85** | **44.41** | **44.77** |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;min…max over seeds | 39.58 | 42.45…42.66 | 43.76…43.94 | 44.31…44.62 | 44.66…45.00 |
| Viewpoint-Q **untrained** | 39.58 | 40.79 | 41.33 | 41.81 | 42.19 |
| EG-C2F | 39.58 | 42.22 | 43.31 | 44.05 | 44.67 |
| C2F | 39.58 | 41.23 | 42.54 | 43.54 | 44.71 |
| Random (safe-box IID, NOT F-IID) | 39.58 | 41.37 | 42.18 | 42.84 | 43.42 |
| *paper Table 4 — EG-C2F* | *39.6* | *42.2* | *43.3* | *44.1* | *44.7* |
| *paper Table 4 — C2F* | *39.6* | *41.3* | *42.5* | *43.6* | *44.7* |

Three things worth reading off it:

1. **The learned policy dominates at every t, by the most EARLY** — +0.36 over EG-C2F at
   t1, +0.54 at t2, converging to +0.10 by t4. Same shape as the reference figure: the
   policy's value is getting to a good canvas *fast*, not a higher ceiling.
2. **t0 = 39.58 for EVERY policy.** That is the check that the full-scene anchor is shared
   and the probe is clean; before the probe-BN fix (canvit_pytorch `1f5121b`) it read 39.03
   and varied per seed.
3. **An UNTRAINED scorer is WORSE than random glimpses** (42.19 vs 43.42 at t4). A
   random-init conv net's argmax picks consistently badly rather than diversely, so the
   trained band is measuring a real learned policy and not "any scorer helps".

## A5. The residual arm gap: the ported trainer beats the harness by a little (2026-07-30)

Earlier text here called the t4 shortfall "about 1σ low, worth a look", and rested the
verdict on *best-checkpoint* CE (0.6859 ± 0.0004 vs 0.6853 ± 0.0007, 4/5 seeds inside the
band). That was too generous a reading. Measured **at the last step, both arms through the
SAME eval in ONE process at eval batch 32** (`claude_dev/unification/compare_arms.py`; all 7
checkpoints, full val):

| arm | n | mean(t1–t4) CE | mIoU t4 | t4 per seed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| band, last step (published) | 8 | 0.6863 | 44.91 | — |
| `rl_train` mode (b) — ported | 2 | **0.6864 ± 0.0008** | **44.91 ± 0.03** | 44.89, 44.93 |
| harness mode (b) — unified | 5 | 0.6880 ± 0.0010 | 44.77 ± 0.13 | 45.00, 44.76, 44.73, 44.70, 44.66 |

**The ported trainer lands exactly on the band; the harness sits 0.0016 CE above it** — about
2.3× the band's own 0.0007 per-seed spread. Both metrics point the same way, which is what
makes it worth taking seriously: a fluke would not move CE and mIoU together.

**But it is not yet statistically established, and cannot be with these group sizes.** Exact
one-sided permutation test over all C(7,2)=21 splits gives **p = 0.095** for both CE and t4 —
and 2/21 is the *floor*: with n=2 vs n=5, even perfect separation cannot reach p < 0.05. A
**third `rl_train` seed** drops the floor to 1/C(8,3) = 0.018 and makes the question
decidable. That is the single cheapest next measurement (~65 min on one A100).

The gap is **training-side, not measurement-side** — §A2's table has both arms' checkpoints
scoring 0.0000 apart under the two evals, and the numbers above come from one process with
one model instance and one loader.

### A5.1 CAUSE FOUND: the harness's policy gradient was exactly 0.8x the reference's

**`rl_train` and the harness are NOT the same training code** — they are two independent
implementations of the same recipe, so a divergence needs no exotic explanation. Reading
both paths end to end turned one up immediately.

`harness/rollout.py` accumulates each glimpse's QReg loss into `chunk_loss`, and the branch
backward divides that by **`n_glimpses`**. But only **`n_glimpses-1`** glimpses are POLICY
glimpses — t0 is the full-scene anchor and carries no policy loss. The reference instead cats
every depth into one `[horizon*B, A]` tensor and takes a single `F.mse_loss`, i.e. **one mean
over `horizon*B`**. So at horizon 4:

```
loss_harness = (1/5) * sum_{t=1..4} mse_t     vs     loss_rl = (1/4) * sum_{t=1..4} mse_t
```

**The harness's scorer gradient was exactly 0.8x the reference's** — measured, not inferred:
ratio `0.800000` on both loss and gradient norm. That is a **20% smaller effective policy LR**
at the same nominal `policy_lr=2e-4`, so the scorer was systematically **under-trained** at a
fixed 8000-step budget. Under-training is the right *direction* for the observed deficit,
which is what makes it the leading candidate.

Nothing compensated: `rl_weight=1.0`, and `policy_lr` equals `rl_train`'s `lr` exactly.
The **VPG path already compensated for this same division** (`* n_glimpses` in the
deferred-credit branch, with a comment explaining why) — only the inline QReg/PG path did not.

Fixed by rescaling the graph term to `ploss * n_glimpses/(n_glimpses-1)`, leaving
`pol_acc["loss"]` on its raw scale so the logged `policy_loss` series stays comparable to
earlier runs and to `rl_train`'s `train_loss`. Pinned by
`harness/tests/test_policy_loss_scale.py`: the fixed gradient is **bit-identical** (atol=0) to
the reference's, and the unfixed one is pinned at exactly 0.8x so a refactor cannot silently
reintroduce it. The `run_rollout` parity digest `9a0100a1a3de3acd` is untouched (it is measured
with no policy attached). Full suite 339 passed.

**This affects every harness QReg/PG policy run, not just ade20k** — including joint distill
policy runs.

**Not yet confirmed as THE cause.** A mechanism being real does not make it the explanation —
see `mechanism-tests-dont-predict-outcomes`. Arm D (`policy-lossfix-s0.sh`, 5 seeds) tests it.

### A5.1b RESULT (2026-07-30): the difference is REAL; the fix explains at most part of it

All 15 checkpoints re-scored at the last step through ONE eval in ONE process at eval batch
32 (`claude_dev/unification/compare_arms.py`, which also runs the exact permutation tests):

| arm | n | mean(t1–t4) CE | mIoU t4 |
|---|---|---|---|
| band, last step | 8 | 0.6863 | 44.91 |
| **arm C** `rl_train` (ported reference) | 5 | **0.6866 ± 0.0008** | **44.854 ± 0.057** |
| arm B harness (0.8× gradient) | 5 | 0.6880 ± 0.0010 | 44.770 ± 0.133 |
| arm D harness + scale fix | 5 | 0.6871 ± 0.0015 | 44.755 ± 0.136 |

Exact one-sided permutation tests (n=5 vs n=5 → 252 splits, attainable floor 0.0040):

| comparison | ΔCE | p | Δt4 | p |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| arm B vs arm C | +0.0014 | **0.0278** | −0.084 | 0.123 |
| arm D vs arm C | +0.0005 | 0.262 | −0.100 | 0.103 |
| arm D vs arm B (improvement) | −0.0009 | 0.151 | −0.016 | 0.583 |

**1. The harness/reference difference is REAL.** Arm B vs arm C on the band's defining metric:
p = 0.0278. This is what n=2 could not establish (its floor was 0.095) and is the answer to
"are they actually different". They are.

**2. Going to n=5 shrank the apparent gap.** Arm C's first two seeds (0.6870, 0.6859) were on
the lucky side of its own distribution; seeds 2–4 came in 0.6857/0.6870/0.6876, moving arm C
from 0.6864 ± 0.0008 to 0.6866 ± 0.0008 and widening its t4 spread. **Do not read an arm's
level off two seeds** — that is what made the first pass of this comparison look cleaner than
the data supported.

**3. The scale fix moved the mean the right way but is NOT individually significant.** Arm D
cuts the CE gap from +0.0014 to +0.0005 (about two thirds), and arm D vs arm C is no longer
detectable (p = 0.26). But arm D vs arm B is only p = 0.151, and **t4 did not improve at all**
(−0.016, p = 0.58). So: "the harness is no longer distinguishable from the reference on CE" is
supported; "the 0.8× was the cause" is **not**. The defect is proven arithmetic; its outcome
effect is at the edge of what 5 seeds can see.

**4. The t4 mIoU shortfall survives in BOTH harness arms and did not respond to the fix.**
Pooling them (they do not differ on t4, p = 0.58) gives n=10 vs n=5: **−0.092, p = 0.078**.
Consistent in direction, never significant, unmoved by the policy-LR change.

**5. The harness is ~2.4× NOISIER on t4** — sd 0.133 / 0.136 vs arm C's 0.057, across both
arms independently. Variance at n=5 is weak evidence, but it is the more distinctive signal
here than the level, and it points at glimpse SELECTION rather than at the optimizer: the
remaining §A5.2 divergence (fp32 vs bf16 logits into the entropy features) flips near-tied
candidates, which is exactly a variance mechanism. **This, not the loss scale, is where I
would look next.**

### A5.4 RETRACTION + RESOLUTION (2026-07-30): the two training paths are BIT-IDENTICAL

**§A5.2 and §A5.3 below are WRONG and are kept only as a record of the reasoning.** There is
no fp32-vs-bf16 feature divergence. Two things I got wrong:

1. `head_logits`'s docstring says "always in fp32", and it does wrap the head in
   `autocast(enabled=False)` — but `get_spatial` is called on the line *before* that guard, so
   it obeys the caller's amp context. I first concluded from the call sites that this created a
   real precision split. **Measured: it does not change the values.** Passing the task's
   already-computed logits into the encoder instead of letting it recompute them is a
   **bit-identical no-op** (measured before the change was reverted). I implemented that
   "fix", measured it, found it changed nothing, and reverted it.
2. Two diagnostic scripts of mine were themselves buggy and manufactured the divergence they
   appeared to detect:
   - the first trace omitted `rollout_and_loss`'s **train-mode scorer forward**, which is what
     updates `frontend.bn`'s running stats before the eval-mode selection reads them. Path A
     therefore selected on stale stats and path B on fresh ones → a fake 14/16 disagreement
     at t1.
   - `diff_training_step.py` (now deleted) reported a 0.36 relative gradient difference from a
     confounded comparison.

**With a correct trace, the paths agree exactly.** Same batch, same scorer, same encoder,
`prime_on_policy=1.0` (no RNG anywhere), BN and reward standardizers restored between runs:

| depth | CE `rl_train` | CE harness | ΔCE | chosen glimpses agreeing |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| t0 | 0.772283 | 0.772283 | +0.000000 | — |
| t1 | 0.753898 | 0.753898 | **+0.000000** | **16/16** |
| t2 | 0.732488 | 0.732488 | **+0.000000** | **16/16** |
| t3 | 0.729524 | 0.729524 | **+0.000000** | **16/16** |
| t4 | 0.725665 | 0.725665 | **+0.000000** | **16/16** |

`reward_frac` matches to all printed digits (+0.015385, and per-depth). Combined with
`test_policy_loss_scale.py` — which pins the loss composition bit-identical (atol=0) — the
forward, the rewards, the targets and the loss are all identical, so the gradient is too.

**Conclusion: after the §A5.1 scale fix there is no remaining code-level divergence in the
training step.** The arm D vs arm C difference (ΔCE +0.0005, p=0.26; Δt4 −0.100, p=0.10) is
seed/stream noise: the two trainers shuffle their data, initialise the scorer and draw
ε-greedy from independent RNG streams, so identical code still gives different runs.

The one thing still unexplained is arm C's *lower variance* (t4 sd 0.057 vs 0.133/0.136). At
n=5 a variance ratio like that is weak evidence (F(4,4) is extremely wide), so it may be
nothing. It cannot be a code difference in the rollout — that is now excluded.

Runnable: `claude_dev/unification/diff_training_trace.py`.

### A5.5 MULTI-STEP identity (2026-07-30) — the single-step claim was not enough

§A5.4 only tested ONE step from a fresh scorer, which cannot see anything that accumulates:
evolving BatchNorm stats, the per-depth reward standardizers, the ε-greedy stream, weight
drift. The owner pushed for a multi-step test, correctly — and pointed out that `rl_train`'s
LOW variance is itself evidence something differs. `diff_training_multistep.py` does it: per
step, from one canonical trajectory, both paths run from the same snapshot on the same batch
with generators re-seeded identically; the gradient, the BN buffers and the standardizer state
are all compared; then the trajectory advances through a real AdamW+LambdaLR.

**20 steps, `prime_on_policy=0.5` (ε-greedy live): IDENTICAL.**

| quantity | result |
|---|---|
| worst relative gradient difference | **5.8e-6** |
| `--self-check` floor (rl_train vs itself, 20 steps) | **6.3e-6** — indistinguishable |
| BN `running_mean` / `running_var` / `num_batches_tracked` | **exactly 0.00e+00, every step** |
| per-depth `RunningNorm` (mean, sq, count) | **exactly 0.00e+00, every step** |
| train-mode scorer forwards per step | asserted equal (4 vs 4) |

The residual ~1e-5 is fp REDUCTION ORDER, not a difference in what is computed: the harness
sums per-depth `mse_loss`es where `rl_train` takes one `mse_loss` over the concatenated
depths. Mathematically identical (`test_policy_loss_scale.py`, atol=0); ~1e-5 on GPU.

**A THIRD script bug of mine got caught here, and this time by the script itself.** The first
multi-step run printed relL2 ≈ 0.5 at every step and `max|dBN|` = exactly 5.00 — because
`TrainSpec.policy_only()` defaults to `BpttSpec(horizon=10)` and I took that default, so I
compared `rl_train` at horizon 4 against the harness at horizon **9**. A BatchNorm
forward-count hook showed 4 vs 9 immediately. The script now asserts equal train-mode scorer
forward counts BEFORE any numeric comparison, and `--self-check` (rl_train as both paths) must
be seen to pass first.

### A5.6 The variance difference IS statistically real, and unexplained

mIoU t4 spread, re-scored: `rl_train` sd **0.057** (n=5) vs the harness's **0.134** (pooled
over arms B and D, n=10, df=8). F = 5.48, **exact permutation p = 0.0433**.

Take it with two caveats: it is **post-hoc** (tested because it looked odd, which inflates the
false-positive rate), and it rests on two outliers — arm B's 45.00 is the highest of all 15
runs and arm D's 44.56 the lowest.

It is also hard to reconcile with §A5.5: if the per-step computation is identical, the
distribution over seeds should be too. So a real variance difference has to come from OUTSIDE
the training step. Checked and matching: data cycling (`run._infinite` re-iterates the
map loader, reshuffling per epoch from global RNG, exactly like `rl_train`'s re-`iter()`), the
LR ramp, the optimizer and its param grouping, `drop_last`/`shuffle`, BN update counts, and
scorer train/eval mode save-restore around eval.

**Unresolved.** Either it is the 1-in-23 fluke, or it lives somewhere none of the above
covers. Only more seeds can separate those — variance estimates at n=5 are very unstable.

### A5.9 FINAL (2026-07-31): all three arms reproduce the published CE band; arm E is a NULL

Deploy (best-mean-CE) checkpoints — the selection the published band and the 8 HF policies use
— scored by our eval at batch 32 on full val. The reference row is the 8 PUBLISHED policies
run through **our** eval, which removes every accounting/batch-size confound (their own doc
says 0.6853 ± 0.0007 / 44.97 ± 0.10, so our eval reproduces them to +0.0003 CE / −0.01 mIoU):

| arm | n | mean(t1–t4) CE | mIoU t4 | ΔCE (p) | Δt4 (p) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **published, our eval** | 8 | 0.6856 ± 0.0006 | 44.96 ± 0.11 | — | — |
| `rl_train` (ported) | 5 | 0.6855 ± 0.0010 | 44.86 ± 0.09 | −0.0000 (0.55) | −0.106 (0.051) |
| harness + scale fix | 5 | 0.6859 ± 0.0009 | 44.87 ± 0.12 | +0.0003 (0.22) | −0.096 (0.082) |
| `rl_train` POOLED (arm E) | 5 | 0.6853 ± 0.0005 | 44.88 ± 0.10 | −0.0002 (0.76) | −0.084 (0.099) |

**Two conclusions.**

**1. The unification goal is met.** The harness is indistinguishable from the ported reference
(0.6859 vs 0.6855, 44.87 vs 44.86) and from the published policies on CE (p = 0.22). CE is the
metric the band is defined by and the one the reward optimizes.

**2. Arm E is a NULL — the pooled rollout does NOT explain the residual.** Pooling the loss
forward over B*H = 64 (the original's architecture, §A5's last substantive difference) moves
t4 by **+0.022, exact one-sided p = 0.377** and CE by −0.0002 (p = 0.393). Neither is a real
effect. So the ~0.1 mIoU t4 shortfall present in *all three* arms is not the rollout
architecture, and — being common to every trainer we have — sits upstream of all of them.

**What is left unaudited, and it is the only surface remaining:** the core-library revisions.
The band was trained on the authors' machine against their own sibling clones at
`bcb9742f`→`007f7173` on a 4090; ours run against these clones on A100s. Their venv's editable
installs now point at *our* checkouts, so their original core cannot be inspected from here.
Verified same, from their source: the frozen backbone repo string, the probe formula,
`unfreeze="none"`, selection under eval-mode BN, per-depth `RunningNorm`, and every recipe
hyperparameter (§A5.10).

Note the shortfall is significant only marginally (p = 0.05…0.10) and CE matches exactly.
Since the reward *is* CE, two policies can tie on CE and differ slightly in mIoU — this may be
a position on the CE/mIoU tradeoff rather than a defect.

### A5.10 What differs from CanViT-PyTorch-RL, read from their source (2026-07-30/31)

Verified **identical**: frozen backbone (`canvitb16-add-vpe-pretrain-g128px-s512px-in21k-dv3b16-2026-02-02`),
probe (`probe-ade20k-40k-s512-c{grid}-in21k`, `unfreeze="none"` so frozen both sides), glimpse
selection under eval-mode BN (`act_fwd` = `with eval_mode(net)`), per-depth `RunningNorm`,
`prime_on_policy=0.5`, `dueling=True`, `train_horizon=4`, `budget_forwards=640_000` → 8000
steps, `batch_size=16`, `eval_every=1000`, separate grad-clip on the scorer, squish, no
augmentation.

Remaining differences, none of which now has evidence of mattering:

1. **Rollout architecture** — theirs pools the loss forward over B*H; ours is per-depth in-graph.
   **TESTED, null** (arm E, above). `--pooled-policy-loss` reproduces theirs exactly (1 BN
   train-forward over 64 vs 4 over 16, counted).
2. **Eval grid** — `rl_train` evaluates at 1000…8000, the harness at 0…7000, so the harness's
   `best.pt` can never be the terminal checkpoint and one eval is spent on the untrained model.
   A real asymmetry; effect likely small (terminal CE 0.6858–0.6890 vs in-run bests ~0.685–0.686,
   so step 8000 would rarely win). Not fixed.
3. **Not ported, no metric path**: MLflow/uv/justfile, sweeps (`search/`), the `policy.eval`
   episode runner, flow.

   **Corrected 2026-09-07.** This item used to also list "the `unfreeze="probe"` ladder and
   Q-Prop trainer extras, `keep_every` step checkpoints". Two of those three were already
   ported and the list was misleading a reader into thinking capability was missing:

   | claimed missing | actual |
   |---|---|
   | `keep_every` step checkpoints | **present** as `--opts.ckpt-every`, writing `step-<n>.pt` alongside `best.pt` / `latest.pt`, plus checkpoint-on-SIGUSR1. The RL version had to be a multiple of `eval_every` (asserted) because its step checkpoints were gated inside the eval branch; this one is independent of eval cadence, so the coupling and its assert are gone. |
   | Q-Prop "extras" | the control variate itself **is** ported — `harness/policy/rl.py`'s `qprop: bool`, the exact-expectation discrete form. The only gap is that it is not wired into **joint** mode, where PG is score-function + entropy floor only; `harness/policy/joint.py` says so at the point of use and deliberately exposes no knob. So: available with a frozen backbone, unavailable when training backbone and policy together. |
   | `unfreeze="probe"` ladder | **Configuration reachable since 2026-09-07; its objective is not.** The RL repo's rung 1 was `unfreeze: {none, probe}` + `probe_lr=1e-5` — train the segmentation head at a tiny LR alongside the policy, backbone frozen. `TrainSpec`'s orthogonal `train_backbone` / `train_head` / `train_policy` + per-group LRs express that shape strictly more generally, but until 2026-09-07 no *preset* produced head+policy with a frozen backbone (`policy_only` = [policy], `joint` = [backbone, head, policy]) and `TrainSpec` was not tyro-exposed, so it could not be reached from the CLI at all. `--spec.*` overrides closed that. See the note below for what still differs. |

   **Resolved 2026-09-07 by `--spec.*` overrides**, which make every `TrainSpec` combination
   reachable rather than only the five named presets — so head+policy with a frozen backbone is
   now `--preset probe --spec.train-policy True --spec.policy-weight 1.0`.

   **This gives the SHAPE of rung 1, not its objective, and the difference matters.** The RL
   repo optimised ONE quantity, `J = mean_t CE_t / CE_t0`, differentiated two ways — score-function
   credit for the policy, the direct `dJ/d(probe)` term for the probe — with its config comment
   stating "Same J, two gradient routes, no loss weights". The harness optimises
   `task_weight * task_loss + policy_weight * policy_loss`: two weighted losses, and the head is
   trained by plain CE rather than by the t0-normalised J. So the override reproduces "probe and
   policy train together, backbone frozen", which is a reasonable configuration in its own right,
   but **not this rung's numbers**. Reproducing those is separate work, and doc 15 records that the
   rung never beat seed noise, so nothing is blocked on it.
4. **Environment**: their 4090 + their core revs vs our A100s + these clones. Unquantifiable
   from here, and GPU nondeterminism alone is non-trivial (§A5.8).

### A5.7 Pipeline coverage — what is MEASURED identical, stage by stage

The owner asked the right question: the multi-step test fed both paths batches from ONE
loader and drove ONE optimizer, so it proved the training step only. Everything else had been
checked by READING, which in this investigation has a bad record. Each stage now has a
measurement:

| stage | check | result |
|---|---|---|
| **data — pixels** | decoded batches from identically-seeded loaders | **bit-exact** (max\|Δ\| = 0 on images and masks) |
| **data — order** | sampler permutation over 3 epochs (60,630 indices) incl. the epoch-boundary reshuffle | **identical**; both reshuffle per epoch |
| **data — workers** | `num_workers` 0 vs 4 | **no effect** on the data |
| **training step** | gradient + BN buffers + per-depth standardizers, 20 steps, ε-greedy live | **5.8e-6** rel (self-check floor 6.3e-6); BN and standardizers **exactly 0** |
| **update** | same synthetic gradient through each path's own AdamW + clip + LambdaLR, 12 steps | **9.1e-8** rel — the known 0.1% LR-ramp off-by-one |
| **eval** | harness eval vs validated eval, 3 model sources | **0.0000** on mIoU t0..t4 + CE (§A2) |

Runnable: `diff_data_pipeline.py`, `diff_training_multistep.py`, `diff_optimizer_path.py`,
`eval_equivalence.py`.

Correction while here: this doc and the exp27 README used to list "workers 4 vs 8" as a
harmless difference. `PolicyTrainConfig.num_workers` is **4**, the same as the launcher — and
worker count provably does not change the data anyway.

**What remains genuinely different between two runs, therefore, is** the scorer's random init
draw, the data order, the ε-greedy stream — and, as §A5.8 shows, GPU nondeterminism, which is
NOT a seed effect and cannot be removed by matching seeds.

### A5.8 The periodic eval has no side effect — and training is not bit-reproducible

The last untested stage (§A5.7) was whether the harness's periodic eval leaves state behind
between training steps. Two channels are possible, and they are not equivalent: **(a)
consuming RNG** shifts the data order / ε-greedy stream — a different trajectory from the same
distribution, i.e. a seed change, which cannot bias the outcome; **(b) mutating state** —
wrong train/eval mode, moved BatchNorm stats, a dirty `StateEncoder` — biases every later step.

Snapshotting every mutable object around ONE eval (`scratchpad/eval_mutates.py` pattern):

| state | after one eval |
|---|---|
| scorer params, scorer BN | **unchanged** |
| `scorer.training`, `head.training`, `canvit.training` | **unchanged** |
| probe head BN buffers | **unchanged** |
| `PolicySelector.generator` (the ε-greedy stream) | **unchanged** |
| per-depth `RunningNorm` | **unchanged** |
| CUDA RNG | **unchanged** |
| CPU RNG | **changed** — the val loader iterates it |
| `StateEncoder.prev` | **dirtied** (left batch-32-shaped from eval vs batch-16 for train) |

Neither survivor is a bias. `reset()` is `self.prev = self.init` and training calls it at every
rollout start (`PolicySelector.start_rollout`), which fully restores the pre-eval encoder state
(measured: 0.000e+00 on all three init tensors). The CPU-RNG shift is channel (a), and
`rl_train`'s eval iterates a val loader too — symmetric, so it cannot explain an arm difference.

**And the control run is the real finding.** `diff_eval_side_effects.py` runs 60 steps
with-eval vs without-eval from one init on one pre-loaded batch stream, plus a CONTROL of
without-eval against **itself**:

```
with-eval vs no-eval    relL2 6.02e-5   5/960 glimpse flips
no-eval  vs no-eval     relL2 6.39e-5   6/960 glimpse flips   <- CONTROL, same code
```

The eval difference is **smaller than the floor**, so there is no eval side effect. But the
control says something more important: **two runs of identical code, identical seed, identical
data and identical init do NOT agree** — 6.4e-5 in weights and 6 flipped glimpses in 60 steps,
from GPU kernel nondeterminism alone, amplifying because a flipped glimpse changes the next
state.

Consequences:

- Part of the run-to-run spread is **irreducible** and has nothing to do with the seed. The
  §A5.6 variance comparison at n=5 per arm was never going to be meaningful.
- A **paired** design (same init + same data for both trainers) reduces the spread but cannot
  eliminate it, because this component survives matching.
- Any future "same seed, therefore same result" claim about this stack is false.

### A5.3 Why §A5.2 was NOT "fixed" while here *(superseded by §A5.4 — the premise was wrong)*

The obvious-looking fix — wrap the t≥1 `sel.select` in `amp_ctx` so the recomputed logits are
bf16 like the reference's — is **wrong**: it would also put the SCORER forward under autocast,
where `rl_train` runs it in fp32. Reference = bf16 logits + fp32 scorer; harness = fp32 logits
+ fp32 scorer; amp-wrapped = bf16 logits + bf16 scorer. That trades one divergence for
another.

The faithful fix is to thread the logits the task already has into `encoder(state, logits=…)`,
matching `rl_train` and removing the redundant probe-head forward. That needs an extra
argument on the `Selector.select` protocol (and so touches `RandomSelector` /
`MixtureSelector`), which is a design change rather than a bug fix — left for the owner rather
than guessed at, especially to chase a p = 0.078 effect.

### A5.2 Two further divergences found, NOT yet fixed *(RETRACTED — see §A5.4: both are no-ops)*

Both concern `PolicySelector.select`, and both are numerical rather than systematic, so they
would act like a seed change rather than a bias:

1. **The selector runs OUTSIDE `amp_ctx` for t>=1.** `run_rollout` wraps the t0 select in
   `with amp_ctx:` (rollout.py:258) but calls the t>=1 select *before* entering the context
   (rollout.py:285-287). So every policy glimpse's encoder + scorer forward runs in **fp32**.
2. **The encoder recomputes the probe logits.** `rl_train` passes the bf16 logits it already
   computed for the CE reward (`encoder(st, logits=logits)`); the harness calls
   `encoder(state)`, and `StateEncoder.__call__` recomputes `head_logits` itself when
   `logits is None`. So the harness's entropy features derive from **fp32** logits where the
   reference's derive from **bf16** ones — and it pays an extra probe-head forward per glimpse
   for the privilege.

Fixing (2) by threading the reward logits through would both match the reference and remove
the redundant forward. Deferred until arm D reports, so that one change is under test at a
time.

Also worth keeping straight: **best-ckpt and last-step tell different stories here.** The
harness is inside the band on best-ckpt CE and outside it on last-step CE. Best-ckpt
selection over 8 evals is a max over noise, so it flatters whichever arm is noisier — and the
harness is (sd 0.133 vs 0.031 on t4). Quote last-step for arm comparisons.

Two earlier observations that still hold: t0 = 39.58 for every policy (the clean-probe
check), and an untrained scorer is worse than random glimpses (42.19 vs 43.42 at t4).
